# Table-Converter
This script uses a BERT model to find the most similar columns between tables A and B and a template table. It encodes each column as a vector and computes the cosine similarity. Then, it selects the columns with the highest similarity for each column of the template table and merges them into a new table. Finally, it converts some columns of the new table to match the template table by generating conversion functions with ChatGPT.
